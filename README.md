# PHP Badwords

## Setup
I suggest to open a local server using **MAMP** to open ```index.php```.

## Description
I made this script in php to censor a word passed by the user in the displayed paragraph.<br>
The script also returns the final paragraph length without the censored word.

## Usage
To make it work you must pass a query string in the url, by adding the ```$badword``` variable.<br><br>
**Example**  ->  "```yourUrl/$badword=word```"
